On Photon OS, `tdnf` is the default package manager for installing new packages. It is a C implementation of the DNF package manager without Python dependencies.  

Tdnf appears in the minimal and full versions of Photon OS. 

Tdnf implements a subset of the `dnf` commands as listed in the [dnf guide](http://dnf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

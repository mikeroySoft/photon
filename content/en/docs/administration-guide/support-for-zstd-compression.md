Zstandard (zstd) is a fast compression algorithm that provides high compression ratios. Photon OS offers support for the zstd compression and allows you to define which compression algorithm you want. 

By using the zstd compression, the following benefits are seen:

- Faster installation of RPMs and the overall system


- Faster builds


- Reduction in the size of artifacts created

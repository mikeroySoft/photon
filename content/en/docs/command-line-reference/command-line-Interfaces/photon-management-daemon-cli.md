# Setup Steps

The pmd-cli utility is included with your Photon OS distribution. To make sure that you have the latest version, you can run:
~~~~
tdnf install pmd-cli
~~~~
# Syntax
~~~~
pmd-cli [connection_auth_options] <component> <command> [command_options]
~~~~
Passed-in parameter values can be enclosed in single (&#39;) or double-quotes (&quot;) as long as you use matching characters to denote the beginning and end of the value. Unless a parameter value contains special characters or spaces, you can also omit quotes altogether.

## Connection / Authorization Options

### Local Connections

For local connections, you omit the connection and authorization options:
~~~~
pmd-cli <component> <cmd> <options>
~~~~
Permissions for the currently logged-in user apply when executing commands. This is the same as specifying --servername localhost.

### Remote Connections

For connecting to a remote server (a server other than the local server), you specify two connection / authorization options:

- ``--servername``: name of the server
- ``--user``: username of a user account on the server

**Note:**  For authentication, you can specify the username (–user &lt;username&gt;) on the command line, but never the password. For security reasons, the system must prompt you for the password.

The option for remote connection is as follows:

**System User**
~~~~
pmd-cli --servername <server> --user <username>
~~~~

## Component

``<component>`` is one of the following values:

- ``firewall``
- ``net``
- ``pkg``
- ``usr``

# Firewall Management

The Photon Management Daemon provides CLI commands to help you get information about the firewall.

## Syntax
~~~~
pmd-cli [connection_auth_options] firewall <command> [command_options]
~~~~
## firewall help

Get help for firewall CLI commands.
~~~~
pmd-cli firewall help
~~~~
## firewall rules

Get a list of the current persistent firewall rules.
~~~~
pmd-cli firewall rules [command-options]
~~~~
This command returns information about each firewall rule, such as the chain to which it belongs, the policy to enforce, the table to manipulate, and so on.

Add a new firewall rule.
~~~~
pmd-cli firewall rules --chain <chain_name> --add <rule_specification>
~~~~
Example:
~~~~
pmd-cli firewall rules --chain INPUT --add "-p tcp -m tcp --dport 21 -j ACCEPT"
~~~~
**Note:** To confirm that the firewall rule was added, run iptables -S. Running pmd-cli firewall rules lists only persistent rules.

Delete a new firewall rule.
~~~~
pmd-cli firewall rules --chain <chain_name> --delete <rule_specification>
~~~~
**Note:**  To confirm that the firewall rule was removed, run iptables -S. Running pmd-cli firewall rules lists only persistent rules.

Make firewall rule changes peristent (add --persist flag)
~~~~
pmd-cli firewall rules --chain <chain_name> --add <rule_specification> --persist
~~~~

## firewall version

Get the version number of the fwmgmt component on the server.
~~~~
pmd-cli firewall version
~~~~
# Network Management

The Photon Management Daemon provides CLI commands to help you manage network interfaces.

## Syntax
~~~~
pmd-cli [connection_auth_options] net <command> [command_options]

Query and control the netmanager subsystem.
  -h --help                    Show this help message and exit
  -v --version                 Show package version

~~~~
Many of these commands require the interface name (–interface &lt;ifname&gt;). Command options are described below.

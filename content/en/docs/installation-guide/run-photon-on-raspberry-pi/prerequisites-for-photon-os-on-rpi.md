1. Download Photon OS. 

    To install Photon OS on a Raspberry Pi, you must download the Photon OS RPi image, which is distributed as a compressed raw disk image with the file extension `.raw.xz`. 
    
    **Note**: You cannot use the Photon ISO to install on RPi. 
    
    Go to the following URL and download the latest release of Photon OS image for RPi: [https://packages.vmware.com/photon/4.0/Beta/rpi/rpi-4.0-d98e681.tar.xz](https://packages.vmware.com/photon/4.0/Beta/rpi/rpi-4.0-d98e681.tar.xz).

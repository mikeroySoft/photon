title:  Enabling Rpi3 Interfaces using Device Tree
weight: 3
---

Photon OS RPI3 images from Photon 3.0 rev2 has Device Tree Overlay support. And these images have compiled Overlays to enable/disable Rpi3 Interface. Perform the following:

**SPI Interface**:
Execute following commands to enable SPI Interface:

```
mkdir /sys/kernel/config/device-tree/overlays/
cat /boot/broadcom/overlays/bcm2837-rpi-enable-spi0.dtbo > /sys/kernel/config/device-tree/overlays/spi/dtbo
```

**Audio Interface**:
Execute following commands to enable Audio Interface:

```
mkdir  /sys/kernel/config/device-tree/overlays/audio
cat /boot/broadcom/overlays/bcm2837-rpi-enable-audio.dtbo >  /sys/kernel/config/device-tree/overlays/audio/dtbo
```
**Note**: Ensure that the **linux-drivers-sound** rpm is installed.

**I2C Interface**:
Execute following command to enable I2C Interface:

```
modprobe i2c-dev
```

#Customizing Device Tree Overlay

Photon OS also provides Device Tree Compilers (i.e. dtc), to compile **Customised Device Tree Overlays**. Execute following command to install dtc on Photon OS:

```
tdnf install dtc
```
Execute following command to compile the overlay: 

```
dtc -@ -O dtb -o my_overlay_dt.dtbo my_overlay_dt.dts
```

## Contributing
The Photon OS project team welcomes contributions from the community.

If you wish to contribute code and you have not signed our Contributor License Agreement (CLA), our CLA-bot will take you through the process and update the issue when you open a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). If you have questions about the CLA process, see our CLA [FAQ](https://cla.vmware.com/faq) or contact us through the GitHub issue tracker.

To help you get started making contributions to Photon OS, we have collected some helpful best practices in the [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/vmware/photon/blob/master/contributing.md).

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a GitHub issue or discuss it first with the official project [maintainers](https://github.com/vmware/photon/blob/dev/AUTHORS.md) via the [#photon Slack Channel](https://vmwarecode.slack.com/messages/photon/), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.
